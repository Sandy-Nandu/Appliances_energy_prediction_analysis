# 📊 Appliances Energy Prediction - Data Analysis  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project focuses on developing a **predictive model** using **Linear Regression** to estimate household energy consumption based on environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and light levels.  

The dataset contains **19,735 instances with 28 features**, including:  
- **Indoor conditions** collected via ZigBee sensors  
- **Weather data** from Chievres Airport, Belgium  

## 🚀 Key Features  
✅ **Data Preprocessing & Analysis** (EDA, correlation matrix, feature selection)  
✅ **Machine Learning Model** (Linear Regression for energy consumption prediction)  
✅ **Evaluation Metrics** (Mean Squared Error, R-squared score)  
✅ **Visualization** (Scatter plots & Heatmaps for insights)  

## 🔧 Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data Processing)  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Visualization)  
- **Scikit-Learn** (Machine Learning)
